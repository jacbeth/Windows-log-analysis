# 📘 Lab 2 — Email Threat Analysis Lab

--- 

## 🎯 Objective
Perform a full SOC‑style investigation of a suspicious email, including header analysis, sender infrastructure, threat‑intel enrichment, and correlation with Microsoft Defender XDR/Sentinel. 
This lab builds on the SIEM foundation created in Lab 1 — Sentinel Workspace Setup & Ingestion Validation.

--- 

## 🧩 Step 1 — Extract & Analyse the Email Header

- Open the email → View Original / View Message Source
- Copy the full header into a header analysis tool

--- 

#### Review:

- S-PF / DKIM / DMARC
- Sending IP
- Return‑Path vs From
- Reply‑To anomalies
- Routing path
- X‑Mailer

## 🌐 Step 2 — Investigate Sender Infrastructure

- WHOIS lookup on sending IP
- Domain age lookup
- Hosting provider identification
- Geolocation vs claimed sender

## 🧪 Step 3 — VirusTotal Analysis

#### URL Analysis
- Submit URL
- Review detections, behaviour, relations

#### Attachment Analysis
- Upload file (if safe)
- Review static + dynamic analysis
- Identify dropped files

#### Evidence

- screenshots/vt-file.png
- Analyst interpretation

## 🛡️ Step 4 — Correlate With Defender XDR / Sentinel

### KQL Queries
Find all emails from the same sender

```kql
EmailEvents
| where SenderFromAddress == "<suspicious sender>"
| summarize count() by RecipientEmailAddress
```

```kql
UrlClickEvents
| where OriginalUrl contains "<domain>"
```

```kql
UrlClickEvents
| where OriginalUrl contains "<domain>"
```

```kql
EmailAttachmentInfo
| where FileName contains "<filename>"
```
