#  Notes – Lab 01

# Powershell script to encode Get-Time 
$cmd = 'Get-Time’  # Defines the command to encode
$bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($cmd) # Converts text into Unicode bytes
$encoded = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes) $encoded # Conversion into a 64 bit string, used to hide commands
$encoded # prints the output

## Initial Observation
- Sysmon Event ID 1 triggered on powershell.exe
- Encoded command present
- Execution policy bypass observed

## Questions Asked
- Was this user-initiated or automated?
- What process spawned PowerShell?
- Is this normal admin behavior?

## Decoding Results
- Base64 decoded using UTF-16LE
- Decoded command: Get-Date
- No additional payloads observed

## Assessment
- Technique is suspicious
- Payload is benign
- Would escalate for deeper review in production

## Lessons Learned
- Get-Date – Powershell misinterpreted the bytes and decoded as Get-Datu
- PowerShell encoding issues can cause malformed commands. Fixed via execution of a single command which generated UTF-16LE, passed it to powershell.exe and executed it immediately
- Always verify PowerShell version and encoding
