## Scenario

A user executed a file masquerading as a legitimate update. Following

execution, persistence was established via a registry run key and an

additional payload was dropped to disk.



---


## Incident Timeline
1. A suspicious executable was present in the user's Downloads directory
2. The file was masquerading as a legitimate update
3. The user executed the file
4. Registry persistence was established
5. Additional artifacts were written to disk

## Evidence



### Sysmon Event ID 1 – Process Creation

- Image: invoice\_update.exe

- User-initiated execution



### Sysmon Event ID 11 – File Creation

- Dropped file: payload.dll



### Sysmon Event ID 13 – Registry Modification

- Run key added for persistence



---



## MITRE ATT\&CK Analysis



### T1204 – User Execution

Execution occurred following direct user interaction.



### T1036 – Masquerading

The executable used a legitimate-looking filename.



### T1547.001 – Registry Run Keys

Persistence was established via the HKCU Run key.



---



## Analysis

The observed behaviour is consistent with common malware execution and

persistence techniques used to maintain access.



---



## Response Actions

- Isolated affected endpoint
- Removed malicious files
- Deleted persistence registry entry
- Recommended antivirus scan and user training



---



## Lessons Learned

Monitoring process execution, file creation, and registry modifications

is critical for detecting malware persistence mechanisms.
