# Lab 3: Malware Execution \& Persistence



## Objective

Simulate malware execution and persistence techniques and investigate the

activity using Sysmon logs.



## Scenario

A user downloaded and executed a file disguised as a legitimate update.

The file created persistence via a registry run key and dropped an

additional payload.



## Tools Used

- Windows 11

- PowerShell

- Sysmon

- Event Viewer



## Detection Summary

Suspicious executable execution was observed followed by file creation

and registry modification, indicating malware persistence behaviour.
