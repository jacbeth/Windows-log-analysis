## Scenario

A suspicious executable masquerading as a legitimate update was present on a user workstation. The user attempted to execute the file, resulting in PowerShell activity and the creation of a temporary file. The activity was detected before any persistence mechanisms were successfully established.

## Technique
EICAR files are used instead of real malware to test services such as Microsoft Defender Antivirus by generating security events without causing any damage.
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H* was saved as eicar.txt and ran in Powershell

## Incident Timeline
1. A suspicious executable was present in the user's Downloads directory
2. The file was masquerading as a legitimate update
3. The user executed the file
4. File was written to temp directory

## Evidence

### Sysmon Event ID 1 – Process Creation
- Image:C:\\WINDOWS\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
- User-initiated execution

### Sysmon Event ID 11 – File Creation
- TargetFileName: C:\\Users\windows11\appdata\local\temp
- File written to the Windows Temp directory
- Indicates potential staging or payload activity

## MITRE ATT\&CK Analysis

### T1204 – User Execution

Execution occurred following direct user interaction.


### T1036 – Masquerading

The executable used a legitimate-looking filename.

---

## Analysis

The observed behaviour demonstrates a common malware execution pattern
where scripting engines are used to perform system actions and write
temporary files. Use of the Temp directory is consistent with malware
attempts to evade user detection while staging additional components.

---

## Response Actions

- Isolated affected endpoint
- Removed malicious files
- Recommended antivirus scan and user training

---

## Lessons Learned

Monitoring process execution and file creation, 
is critical for detecting malware persistence mechanisms.
